# Innovator dashboard

## The first chrome extension that I made was when I found out that I had been accepted into the Google for Education Certified Innovator Program. It was pretty crude, but I got it to work. Since then I have learned a lot, and I figured it was time to update the thing to be a little more functional. So I thought it best to incorporate Tasks API, to help keep track of the many responsibilities we all have! (Also, trying to learn a little bit about Chrome extensions in the process)
